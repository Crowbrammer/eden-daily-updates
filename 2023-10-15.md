# Aaron's daily update: 2023-10-15

## Done yesterday:

* Studied and nutshelled the [https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceaec4fnhlfr3ws4f3z7i7fe4bru3slyzohpjukl6bcaoktgmeifmm?filename=Nathan%20Daniels%20-%20RTOR_%20Roguelike%20Theory%20of%20Relativity%20(2009).pdf ROTR doc].
* Followed Yama's coding process. 
* Understood Yama's intent to announce by December (< two months)
* Grouped/organized wiki links

## Do today:

* Dogfood the game: Mentally play it to see where we're going with it 
* Try to telnet into Yama's test server
* Identify missing skills related to prioritized tasks
* Prioritize authentication methods: Do we use a website, Discord, telnet, or some combo with 2FA to avoid bots?

## Obstacles:

* Could confirm the big-picture overview. Current understanding: "A realtime MUD/roguelike that exists interdependently with us. We improve it by by playing,  but it and all the entities live there whether we're playing or not" 
* Need to verify [[Tasks|task list here]] is prioritized
* Don't have the skills yet to assist with high-priority tasks
