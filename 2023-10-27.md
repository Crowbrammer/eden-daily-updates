# Letters to Yama: 2023-10-27

## Done yesterday:
- I went meta. I'm taking a course on study efficiency. I watched a demonstration of how to encode things better. 

## Do today: 
- More of the study efficiency course.
- Use what I learn on some OpenVPN docs

## Obstacles:
- Probably overthinking this. Should just use Zoom or something re: Yama and I.
