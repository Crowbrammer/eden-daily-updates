# Eden scrum: 2023-11-10

## Done yesterday:
- just hung out for a bit.
- tested if Yama read this by writing "cock and balls" in every section

## Do today:
- keep the faith in Escaping Eden even if Yama doesn't believe in me... 

## Obstacles:
- I got hit pretty hard by Yama wanting to switch. My issue with this is the reason for switching: "something that we can develop together". He doesn't acknowledge learning as progress... only explicit features count. I'm trying to resolve to keep the course anyway.
