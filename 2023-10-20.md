# Aaron's daily update: 2023-10-20

## Done yesterday:
- I can't start and access a local server on WSL, so I read about IP to better myself toward solving this:
  - Learned that IP's about locating, formatting, and delivering.
  - I focused on locating, which is about
    - IP address anatomy, i.e. network, host sections
    - The old school classful IP's vs. classless
    - How subnetting's used
    - A little bit about Network Address Translation (NAT)
  - Read Yama's UI code re: building 

## Do today:
- ~~Further study IP~~
- ~~Try to apply it to figuring out how telnet's not connecting to my local Eden server~~
- Mess around with my local version of Eden
- See what features I might be able to work on

## Obstacles:
- Don't know what feature to work on next lol
- ~~I don't have an accurate mental map of how WSL and Windows talks, because common knowledge isn't working here:~~ (I figured it out while writing this)
  - ~~\[computer name\].local doesn't work~~
  - ~~using the IP associated with `nameserver` at `/etc/resolv.conf` doesn't work (it times out)~~
  - ~~using any of the IPs with the ipconfig doesn't work~~
  - ~~I can't host the server on WSL and then access it from WSL...~~
    - ~~I can run the exe, it works, but I can't telnet to it... the following server.conf's doesn't work~~
    - ~~`localhost`~~
    - ~~127.0.1.1 (WSL's version of localhost)~~
    - SCRATCH EVERYTHING, I tried the IPv4 address from vEthernet section for WSL in ipconfig (from Powershell) for the server.conf, telnetted to it, and it worked.
