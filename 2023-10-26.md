# Letters to Yama: 2023-10-26

## Done yesterday:
- Reviewed Yama's code (Telnet and something else?)
- Learned Telnet commands (255, IAC, 250 SB?) 
- Learned Docker-like Terraform and it's limits (not running commands)
- Reviewed some OpenVPN docs

## Do today:
- Study OpenVPN and Terraform (try to get Discord voice/video working at the library)


## Obstacles:
- Don't understand the principle behind why my audio/video doesn't work at the library Wi-Fi (something firewall)
