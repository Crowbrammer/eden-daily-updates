# Aaron's letters to Yama: 2023-10-24

## Done yesterday:
- tried to get UI main ideas (drawing, windows, menus, input)
- learned `defer`, Go mutexes
- tried to fix the constant errors:
  - failing to do that, I tried to understand why the modules weren't talking to one another
  - failing to do that, I tried to understand how it apparently pulled the module but not the defined constants within the module

## Do today:
- Research more on Go modules/comms... 
- ^ experiment until I understand the constants issue
- read to understand the big picture of the UI

## Obstacles:
- some unconscious incompetence on some Go things...
- Conscious incompetence on the UI
