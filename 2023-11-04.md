# Letters to Yama: 2023-11-04

## Done yesterday:

- Reviewed the EE codebase
- Tried to pay a person to set up OpenVPN
- The person recommended OpenVPN Access Server. I read about OpenVPN Access Server and tried to set that up
- Looked up some computer networking courses.

## Do today: 

- Do some study techniques to understand the EE codebase better. 

## Obstacles:

- OpenVPN Access Server should finish setting up when I ssh into it. 
- I haven't been able to ssh into it except through EC connect. 
- when I connect to the ovpn ec2 instance  EC connect doesn't trigger OpenVPN Access Server
