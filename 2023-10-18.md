# Aaron's daily update: 2023-10-18

## Done yesterday:
- Visualized playing the game at the end
  - Raids
  - Multitile monsters
  - Spinning blades
  - Projectile beams that light up a line of tiles for multiple ticks
  - Lock-on-based targeting
- Built a backlog of networking reading material

## Do today:
- Review the task list
- Verify that my plan of study makes sense
- Study some of the networking texts

## Obstacles: 
 - Are these the right things to study and focus on?
 - Unsure if ideas are welcome or if I'm painting over Yama's vision of the game
