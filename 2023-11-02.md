# Letters to Yama: 2023-11-02

## Done yesterday:
- Studied OpenVPN
- Tested game
- Read some of the codebase

## Do today:
- Try to get an OpenVPN server up
- Study the Go/Go module docs to see why the build's failing
- Study the codebase

## Obstacles:
- I'm prioritizing establishing Discord VC from the library. The library's blocking Discord VC. It's blocked every VPN I've tried so far. 
- I also don't know enough networking to know if my particular VPN would work nor how to set it up... I'm also afraid I won't get it work.
