# Letters to Yama: 2023-10-29

## Done yesterday:
I reviewed the subjects I've learned so far: 
- EE structure (whole, UI), 
- Golang stuff (modules, defer, mutexes, iota), 
- telnet (some commands), IP stuff (locating, formatting, delivering),
- Terraform (write, plan, apply... resources), and 
- OpenVPN (TUNnels, packets (TAP), bridging, routing, VPC)

## Do today:
- Study OpenVPN (enable comms at library)

## Obstacles:

- lack of knowledge to set up OpenVPN
- unsure if OpenVPN will actually enable Discord calling
