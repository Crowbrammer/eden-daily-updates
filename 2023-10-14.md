# Aaron daily update: 2023-10-14

## Done yesterday:
### Review Yama convo 

* Relearned that wiki documentation is important. 
* Wasted time on the Discord Chat Exporter. 
* Looked at past project examples 

### Observed Yama's coding process

* A map is made of chunks
* These chunks are turned into planes
* These planes are drawn with a couple for loops 
* At each item, consider the distance to the player for what symbol to draw 

### Thought experiments

* avoiding pickaxing through dungeons, 
* what constitutes a skill,
* what materials are able to get others (Mohs hardness idea)

I attempted to start and telnet into Eden. I've learned about ipconfig and /etc/resolv.conf, but none of the addresses enabled access (one didn't error but stalled). 

## Do today: 
Read Yama's update and try to understand it. Build a study queue for Windows networking stuff to learn how to overcome the telnet issue. 

## Obstacles: 
Difficulty telnetting in is probably distracting me from the documentation work.
