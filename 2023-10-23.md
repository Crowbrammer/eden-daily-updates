# Aaron's letters to Yama: 2023-10-22

## Done yesterday:
- Overviewed the code (agent(?) -> UI -> manager -> data)
- Attempted to understand the UI 
- learned the iota constant idiom in Go :) 

## Do today:
(Feature focus: player can build a workbench.)
- Get an overview of the UI (sort of like I have an overview of the whole)
- Try to learn the codebase more deeply

## Obstacles:
- Idk how things are drawn
- Idk how window are drawn
- Idk how a "pending workbench installation" should look like
- ^ Idk the utf8 symbols to use
- Idk how to make it work with the current build menu...
