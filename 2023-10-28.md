# Letters to Yama: 2023-10-28

## Done yesterday:
- Read some of/Watched Yama code
- Tested EE
- Encoded OpenVPN docs (awareness of tunnels, routing vs. bridging, VPC's)
- Meta: Consumed part of a study efficiency improvement course (iCanStudy)

## Do today:
- Meta: "Kolb's cycle" on my encoding (study efficiency)
- Encode more OpenVPN docs (Yama comm at library)

## Do today:
- Do we really want to invest my time in getting OpenVPN set up? 
- Will a VPN really help with Discord video calls at my library?
