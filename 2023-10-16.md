# Aaron's daily update: 2023-10-16

## Done yesterday:

### EE UI
* Put effort in to understanding the race condition Yama discussed, re: the help menu
* Gave feedback on player registration, which helped Yama clear up the UI.
* Put forward ideas on help modal alternatives.

### Network

* Telnetted into Yama's Eden server - multiplayer works!

### Golang competence 
* Stayed up late to learn some Go stuff from Yama
* Did a couple experiments to understand how Go modules talk together in a package
* Figured out Go constant declaration
* Used that to refactor the code, re: unicode use.

## Do today:

* Read Yama's commits
* See Yama's priorities
* Try studying relevant Go/networking materials to eventually assist on priority work

## Obstacles: 

* Could use more comms on priorities and the big picture
