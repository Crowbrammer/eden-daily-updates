# Letters to Yama: 2023-11-1

## Done yesterday:
- Studied OpenVPN docs 
- Tried to implement OpenVPN tuts
- Tried to use Opera's VPN (didn't work)

## Do today:
- Review Yama's commits/codebase
- Study OpenVPN
- face the harder parts of the OpenVPNtutorials

## Obstacles:
- Given how my library shut down two VPNS, I wonder if there's something fundamental that I can't get around. This doubt was slowing me down, but I'm going to keep trying.
