# Aaron's daily update: 2023-10-22

## Done yesterday:
 - (Meta) Learned a skill-based approach to coding features (ID feature -> ID related skill -> try to improve skill)
 - Found my focus: I want to let the player build, move a workbench around, and set it

## Do today:
 - "prestudy" the EE codebase... 
 - play a little of EE

## Obstacles:
 - Idk the codebase
 - Idk how to draw and move things on the screen,
 - Idk how I'd go about that without messing other stuff up
